## reproducibility

This project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#reproducibility): 

- `renv::snapshot()` save state
- `renv::restore()` load state  

where state refers to package versions used by the project.  

## targets analysis pipeline

This project also uses a function based analysis pipeline using [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/)

Useful console functions:

- `tar_edit()` opens a the make file
- `tar_make()` to run targets
- `tar_visnetwork()` to view pipeline

# This is the current pipeline

```{r,message=FALSE,warning=FALSE,echo=FALSE}

targets::tar_visnetwork()

```

# How much help do you need? An acute investigation into perceptions of load lifted during forced repetitions.

A study exploring how much a spotter assists with forced repetitions, and the accuracy of a trainees perceptions of the amount of assistance they provide.

## reproducibility

This project uses [`renv`](https://rstudio.github.io/renv/articles/renv.html#reproducibility): 

- `renv::snapshot()` save state
- `renv::restore()` load state  

where state refers to package versions used by the project.  

## targets analysis pipeline

This project also uses a function based analysis pipeline using [`targets`](https://books.ropensci.org/targets/)

Useful console functions:

- `tar_edit()` opens a the make file
- `tar_make()` to run targets
- `tar_visnetwork()` to view pipeline

## This is the current pipeline

```{r message=FALSE}

targets::tar_visnetwork(
  # this first argument is only required for static output
  # https://github.com/ropensci/targets/discussions/819
  callr_arguments = list(spinner = FALSE), 
  targets_only = TRUE)


```

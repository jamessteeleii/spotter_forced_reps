  abstract = {Acute hormonal and neuromuscular responses and recovery three days after the exercises were examined during the maximum repetitions (MR) and forced repetitions (FR) resistance exercise protocols in 16 male athletes. MR included 4 sets of leg presses, 2 sets of squats and 2 sets of knee extensions (with 12 RM) with a 2-min recovery between the sets and 4 min between the exercises. In FR the initial load was chosen to be higher than in MR so that the subject could not lift 12 repetitions per set by himself. After each set to failure the subject was assisted to perform the remaining repetitions to complete the 12 repetitions per set. Thus the exercise intensity was greater in FR than in MR. Both loading protocols led to the great acute increases (p {$<$} 0.05 - 0.001) in serum testosterone, free testosterone, cortisol and GH concentrations. However, the responses in cortisol (p {$<$} 0.05) and GH (p {$<$} 0.01) were larger in FR than in MR. The decrease of 56.5 \% (p {$<$} 0.001) in maximal isometric force in FR was greater (p {$<$} 0.001) than that of 38.3 \% in MR (p {$<$} 0.001) and force remained lower (p {$<$} 0.01) during the recovery in FR compared to MR. The larger decrease in isometric strength in FR than in MR was also associated with the decreased maximal voluntary EMG of the loaded muscles. The data indicate that the forced repetition exercise system induced greater acute hormonal and neuromuscular responses than a traditional maximum repetition exercise system and therefore it may be used to manipulate acute resistance exercise variables in athletes.},

  abstract = {The aim of the present study was to investigate acute hormonal and neuromuscular responses and recovery in strength athletes versus nonathletes during heavy resistance exercise performed with the forced and maximum repetitions training protocol. Eight male strength athletes (SA) with several years of continuous resistance training experience and 8 physically active but non-strength athletes (NA) volunteered as subjects. The experimental design comprised two loading sessions: maximum repetitions (MR) and forced repetitions (FR). MR included 12-RM squats for 4 sets with a 2-min recovery between sets. In FR the initial load was higher than in MR so that the subject could lift approximately 8 repetitions by himself and 4 additional repetitions with assistance. Before and after the loading protocols, blood samples were drawn to determine serum testosterone, free testosterone, cortisol and growth hormone concentrations, and blood lactate. Maximal voluntary isometric force and EMG activity of the leg extensors was measured before and after the loading as well as 24 and 48 hrs after the loading. The concentrations of the hormones measured increased significantly (p {$<$} .01-.001) after both loadings in both groups. The responses tended to be higher in FR than the MR loading and the increases of testosterone concentrations were significantly (p {$<$} .01) greater in both loadings in SA than in NA. Both loading protocols in both groups also led to neuromuscular fatigue observable with significant acute decreases in isometric strength by 32-52\% (p {$<$} .001) and in maximal iEMG (p {$<$} .05-01) associated with large increases in blood lactate. These data suggest that, at least in experienced strength athletes, the forced-repetition protocol is a viable alternative to the more traditional maximum-repetition protocol and may even be a superior approach.},

A force constant, defined in the paper, as the applied force at which perception of effort approximates two-thirds of maximum seems to discriminate effectively between the muscle groups concerned.

Yet theories and findings in experimental psychology either ignore this causal effect heterogeneity or treat it as uninteresting error. This is the case even when data are available to examine effect heterogeneity directly, in within-subjects designs where experimental effects can be examined subject by subject. Using data from four repeated-measures experiments, we show that effect heterogeneity can be modeled readily, that its discovery presents exciting opportunities for theory and methods, and that allowing for it in study designs is good research practice. This evidence suggests that experimenters should work from the assumption that causal effects are heterogeneous. Such a working assumption will be of particular benefit, given the increasing diversity of subject populations in psychology. (PsycINFO Database Record (c) 2019 APA, all rights reserved)},

First, in response to heightened concern that our published research literature is incomplete and untrustworthy, we need new requirements to ensure research integrity. These include prespecification of studies whenever possible, avoidance of selection and other inappropriate data-analytic practices, complete reporting, and encouragement of replication. Second, in response to renewed recognition of the severe flaws of null-hypothesis significance testing (NHST), we need to shift from reliance on NHST to estimation and other preferred techniques. The new statistics refers to recommended practices, including estimation based on effect sizes, confidence intervals, and meta-analysis. The techniques are not new, but adopting them widely would be new for many researchers, as well as highly beneficial. This article explains why the new statistics are important and offers guidance for their use. It describes an eight-step new-statistics strategy for research with integrity, which starts with formulation of research questions in estimation terms, has no place for NHST, and is aimed at building a cumulative quantitative discipline.},

  abstract = {Some research suggests that strength improvements are greater when resistance training continues to the point at which the individual cannot perform additional repetitions (i.e., repetition failure). Performing additional forced repetitions after the point of repetition failure and thus further increasing the set volume is a common resistance training practice. However, whether short-term use of this practice increases the magnitude of strength development with resistance training is unknown and was investigated here. Twelve basketball and 10 volleyball players trained 3 sessions per week for 6 weeks, completing either 4 x 6, 8 x 3, or 12 x 3 (sets x repetitions) of bench press per training session. Compared with the 8 x 3 group, the 4 x 6 protocol involved a longer work interval and the 12 x 3 protocol involved higher training volume, so each group was purposefully designed to elicit a different number of forced repetitions per training session. Subjects were tested on 3- and 6-repetition maximum (RM) bench press (81.5 +/- 9.8 and 75.9 +/- 9.0 kg, respectively, mean +/- SD), and 40-kg Smith Machine bench press throw power (589 +/- 100 W). The 4 x 6 and 12 x 3 groups had more forced repetitions per session (p {$<$} 0.01) than did the 8 x 3 group (4.1 +/- 2.6, 3.1 +/- 3.5, and 1.2 +/- 1.8 repetitions, respectively), whereas the 12 x 3 group performed approximately 40\% greater work and had 30\% greater concentric time. As expected, all groups improved 3RM (4.5 kg, 95\% confidence limits, 3.1- 6.0), 6RM (4.7 kg, 3.1-6.3), bench press throw peak power (57 W, 22-92), and mean power (23 W, 4-42) (all p {$<$} or = 0.02). There were no significant differences in strength or power gains between groups. In conclusion, when repetition failure was reached, neither additional forced repetitions nor additional set volume further improved the magnitude of strength gains. This finding questions the efficacy of adding additional volume by use of forced repetitions in young athletes with moderate strength training experience.},

RESULTS: Analyses revealed a significant reduction in MVIT (P\,{$<$}\,0.05) with a significant between-condition effect, and significant post-hoc pairwise comparisons between LL and both HL (P\,=\,0.044) and FR (P\,=\,0.013). There were no significant between-condition effects for effort or discomfort (P\,{$>$}\,0.05). DISCUSSION: Fatigue as a decrement in force production appears to follow a more complex relationship than simply 100\% minus the force requirements of the task relative to a maximal voluntary contraction.

Methods: A systematic review and meta-analysis were performed for performance/ functional outcomes and/or body composition measurements. Results: 12 studies were included in the review; 301 and 276 participants were in supervised and unsupervised groups, respectively. The main model for all performance/function effects revealed a small, standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.28 [95\%CI = 0.02 to 0.55]). For sub-grouped outcome types, there was very poor precision of robust estimates for speed, power, function, and endurance. However, for strength there was a moderate effect favouring SUP (0.40 [95\%CI = 0.06 to 0.74]). The main model for all body composition effects revealed a trivial standardised point estimate favouring SUP (0.07 [95\%CI = -0.01 to 0.15]). Conclusions: Supervised resistance training, compared to unsupervised training, might produce a small effect on increases in performance/function, most likely in strength, but has little impact on body composition outcomes.},

A total of 12 healthy adults and volunteers, who had previously practiced endurance activities for 4 to 8 h per week, performed a one-hour cognitive task involving either the process of response inhibition (Stroop task) or not (visualization of a documentary as control task), then 20 min of pedaling on a cycle ergometer at a constant perception of effort while cardio-respiratory and neuromuscular functions were measured. The Stroop task induces subjective feelings of mental fatigue (vigor: 3.92 {\textpm} 2.61; subjective workload: 58.61 {\textpm} 14.57) compared to the control task (vigor: 5.67 {\textpm} 3.26; p = 0.04; subjective workload: 32.5 {\textpm} 10.1; p = 0.005). This fatigue did not act on the produced perceived effort, self-imposed, and did not affect the cardio-respiratory or neuromuscular functions during the subsequent physical task whose type was medium-term endurance. Regardless of the mental condition, the intensity of physical effort is better controlled when the participants in physical activity control their perception of effort. Mental fatigue does not affect subsequent physical performance but estimated perceived exertion, which increases with the intensity and duration of the exercise.},

  abstract = {The perception of effort during exercise and its relationship to fatigue is still not well understood. Although several scales have been developed to quantify exertion Borg's 15-point ratings of perceived exertion (RPE) scale has been adopted as a valid and reliable instrument for evaluating whole body exertion during exercise. However, Borg's category-ratio scale is useful in quantifying sensations of exertion related to those variables that rise exponentially with increases in exercise intensity. Previous research has examined the extent to which afferent feedback arising from cardiopulmonary and peripheral variables mediates the perception of exertion. However, the literature has not identified a single variable that consistently explains exertion ratings. It is concluded that effort perception involves the integration of multiple afferent signals from a variety of perceptual cues. In a process defined as teleoanticipation, the changes in perceived exertion that result from these afferent signals may allow exercise performance to be precisely regulated such that a task can be completed within the biomechanical and metabolic limits of the body. The accuracy with which individuals can regulate exercise intensity based upon RPE values, the decrease in muscle recruitment (central drive) that occurs before fatigue, and the extent to which perceived exertion and heart rate can be altered with hypnosis and biofeedback training all provide evidence for the existence of such a regulatory system. Future research is needed to precisely quantify the extent to which efferent feedforward commands and afferent feedback determine pacing strategies such that an exercise event can be completed without irreversible tissue damage.},

  abstract = {We discuss problems the null hypothesis significance testing (NHST) paradigm poses for replication and more broadly in the biomedical and social sciences as well as how these problems remain unresolved by proposals involving modified p-value thresholds, confidence intervals, and Bayes factors. We then discuss our own proposal, which is to abandon statistical significance. We recommend dropping the NHST paradigm---and the p-value thresholds intrinsic to it---as the default statistical paradigm for research, publication, and discovery in the biomedical and social sciences. Specifically, we propose that the p-value be demoted from its threshold screening role and instead, treated continuously, be considered along with currently subordinate factors (e.g., related prior evidence, plausibility of mechanism, study design and data quality, real world costs and benefits, novelty of finding, and other factors that vary by research domain) as just one among many pieces of evidence. We have no desire to ``ban'' p-values or other purely statistical measures. Rather, we believe that such measures should not be thresholded and that, thresholded or not, they should not take priority over the currently subordinate factors. We also argue that it seldom makes sense to calibrate evidence as a function of p-values or other purely statistical measures. We offer recommendations for how our proposal can be implemented in the scientific publication process as well as in statistical decision making more broadly.},

  abstract = {For decades, researchers have observed that eccentric (ECC) muscle strength is greater than concentric (CON) muscle~strength. However, knowledge of the ECC:CON strength ratio is incomplete and might inform resistance exercise prescriptions. Our purposes were to determine the magnitude of the ECC:CON ratio of human skeletal muscle in vivo and explore if sex, age, joint actions/exercises, and movement velocity impact it. A total of 340 studies were identified through searches. It was possible to analyse 1516 ECC:CON ratios, aggregated from 12,546 individuals who made up 564 groups in 335 of the identified studies. Approximately 98\% of measurements occurred on isokinetic machines. Bayesian meta-analyses were performed using log-ratios as response variables then exponentiated back to raw ratios. The overall main model estimate for the ECC:CON ratio was 1.41 (95\% credible interval [CI] 1.38-1.44). The ECC:CON ratio was slightly less in men (1.38 [CI 1.34-1.41]) than women (1.47 [CI 1.43-1.51]), and greater in older adults~(1.62 [CI 1.57-1.68]) than younger adults (1.39 [CI 1.36-1.42]). The ratio was similar between grouped upper-body (1.42 [CI 1.38-1.46]) and lower-body joint actions/exercises (1.40 [CI 1.37-1.44]). However, heterogeneity in the ratio existed across joint actions/exercises, with point estimates ranging from 1.32 to 2.61. The ECC:CON ratio was most greatly impacted by movement velocity, with a 0.20\% increase in the ratio for every 1{$^\circ$}/s increase in velocity. The results show that~ECC muscle~strength is\,{\textasciitilde}\,40\% greater than CON muscle~strength. However, the ECC:CON ratio is greatly affected by movement velocity and to lesser extents age and sex. Differences between joint actions/exercises likely exist, but more data are needed to provide more precise estimates.},

However, 1 variable that has received little discussion is set endpoints (i.e., the endpoint of a set of repetitions). Set endpoints in RT are often considered to be proximity to momentary failure and are thought to be a primary variable determining effort in RT. Further, there has been ambiguity in the use and definition of terminology that has created issues in interpretation of research findings. The purpose of this paper was to: (1) provide an overview of the ambiguity in historical terminology around set endpoints; (2) propose a clearer set of definitions related to set endpoints; and (3) highlight the issues created by poor terminology and definitions.

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Augmented feedback is often used during resistance training to enhance acute physical performance and has shown promise as a method of improving chronic physical adaptation. However, there are inconsistencies in the scientific literature regarding the magnitude of the acute and chronic responses to feedback and the optimal method with which it is provided. OBJECTIVE: This systematic review and meta-analysis aimed to (1) establish the evidence for the effects of feedback on acute resistance training performance and chronic training adaptations; (2) quantify the effects of feedback on acute kinematic outcomes and changes in physical adaptations; and (3) assess the effects of moderating factors on the influence of feedback during resistance training. METHODS: Twenty studies were included in this systematic review and meta-analysis. This review was performed using the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses (PRISMA) guidelines. Four databases were searched, and studies were included if they were peer-reviewed investigations, written in English, and involved the provision of feedback during or following dynamic resistance exercise. Furthermore, studies must have evaluated either acute training performance or chronic physical adaptations. Risk of bias was assessed using a modified Downs and Black assessment tool. Multilevel meta-analyses were performed to quantify the effects of feedback on acute and chronic training outcomes. RESULTS: Feedback enhanced acute kinetic and kinematic outputs, muscular endurance, motivation, competitiveness, and perceived effort, while greater improvements in speed, strength, jump performance, and technical competency were reported when feedback was provided chronically. Furthermore, greater frequencies of feedback (e.g., following every repetition) were found to be most beneficial for enhancing acute performance. Results demonstrated that feedback improves acute barbell velocities by approximately 8.4\% (g\,=\,0.63, 95\% confidence interval [CI] 0.36-0.90). Moderator analysis revealed that both verbal (g\,=\,0.47, 95\% CI 0.22-0.71) and visual feedback (g\,=\,1.11, 95\% CI 0.61-1.61) were superior to no feedback, but visual feedback was superior to verbal feedback. For chronic outcomes, jump performance might have been positively influenced (g\,=\,0.39, 95\% CI -\,0.20 to 0.99) and short sprint performance was likely enhanced (g\,=\,0.47, 95\% CI 0.10-0.84) to a greater extent when feedback is provided throughout a training cycle. CONCLUSIONS: Feedback during resistance training can lead to enhanced acute performance within a training session and greater chronic adaptations. Studies included in our analysis demonstrated a positive influence of feedback, with all outcomes showing superior results than when no feedback is provided. For practitioners, it is recommended that high-frequency, visual feedback is consistently provided to individuals when they complete resistance training, and this may be particularly useful during periods of low motivation or when greater competitiveness is beneficial. Alternatively, researchers must be aware of the ergogenic effects of feedback on acute and chronic responses and ensure that feedback is standardised when investigating resistance training.},

Show me, tell me, encourage me: The effect of different forms of feedback on resistance training performance. J Strength Cond Res 34(11): 3157-3163, 2020-When performing resistance training, verbal kinematic feedback and visual kinematic feedback are known to enhance performance. In addition, providing verbal encouragement can assist in the attenuation of fatigue. However, the effects of these forms of feedback have never been compared. Consequently, this study aimed to quantify the effects of verbal kinematic feedback and visual kinematic feedback, and verbal encouragement on barbell velocity during the back squat. Furthermore, changes in performance were related to individual-reported conscientiousness. Twelve semiprofessional rugby union players volunteered to participate in the study that consisted of the subjects completing a set of the barbell back squat across 4 conditions (i.e., no-feedback [control], verbal feedback of kinematic information [verbal], visual feedback of kinematic information [visual], and verbal encouragement [encouragement]). In addition, participants completed a questionnaire before the study to assess conscientiousness. Magnitude-based inferences were used to assess differences between conditions, whereas Spearman's rank correlation coefficient was used to assess relationships between conscientiousness and changes in barbell velocity. All 3 forms of feedback showed almost certain improvements in barbell velocity, while differences between interventions were likely to very likely trivial. Changes in barbell velocity showed small to large inverse relationships with conscientiousness. These findings suggest that practitioners should supply kinematic feedback (verbally or visually) or, when technology is not available, provide athletes with encouraging statements while resistance training. Verbal encouragement may be of greatest benefit for individuals who demonstrate low levels of conscientiousness. Given these findings, practitioners are advised to use either technology or verbal encouragement to manipulate acute training outcomes.},
